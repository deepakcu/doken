# Doken - Patient management, simplified!

You walk-in to a clinic or hospital, get a token
and wait for your token to be called. As you wait with other sick patients in the crowded waiting room, you are clueless whether your number will be called soon or how long you have to wait. You are worried about spreading your infection or getting infected from other sick folks around. Does this situation sounds familiar? Many hospitals and clinics around the world face this situation every day due to lack of patient management systems. Small and medium clinics don't have necessary skills and financial capacity to build and maintain complex patient management systems. Proper patient management is necessary especially during pandemics since patients packed in waiting rooms can quickly spread infection.

Doken is a simple patient management app for small and medium walk-in clinics. Doken is available freely for download from Google playstore. The interface is intuitive for both the patient and the doctor. If you are a patient, you can use Doken to track how many patients are waiting in waiting line before you. No registration is required. If you are a doctor, Doken lets you check-in and check-out patient walk-ins with a simple touch and patients waiting in line immediately get your updates.

Doken doesn't replace existing booking systems. Instead, it implements a "virtual patient line" that works along with existing booking systems. 

Here's how it works.

Once the patient make an appointment with the clinic by phone or walk-in appointment, they are given a number in the line by incrementing a token number. As patients are consulted, the clinic updates the 'virtual waiting line'. Patients can monitor the head of the line remotely using the app and decide the right time to walk-in for the appointment.

Doctors can register on the app by providing three simple details: clinic name, email id and password. Once registered, they can sign-in using email/password. Patients do not require any registration, simplifying adoption.
